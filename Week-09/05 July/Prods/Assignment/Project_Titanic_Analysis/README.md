## Titanic Dataset Analysis Project

Welcome to the Titanic Dataset Analysis Project! This project aims to explore various aspects of the Titanic passenger data through a menu-driven interface. Here's an overview of the analyses you can perform and how to navigate through the project.

### Project Structure

1. **Survival Analysis**
   - Overall Survival Rate
   - Survival by Class
   - Survival by Gender
   - Survival by Age Group
   - Survival by Family Size

2. **Demographic Analysis**
   - Passenger Count by Class
   - Gender Distribution
   - Age Distribution
   - Embarkation Port Analysis

3. **Financial Analysis**
   - Ticket Fare Distribution
   - Average Fare by Class
   - Fare vs. Survival

4. **Class Analysis**
   - Passenger Demographics by Class
   - Survival Rates by Class and Gender
   - Fare Analysis by Class

5. **Additional Insights**
   - Family Relationships and Survival
   - Cabin Location Analysis (if data available)
   - Name Analysis (e.g., titles and survival)

### Functions Overview

#### 1. Survival Analysis

- **Overall Survival Rate**: Calculates the percentage of passengers who survived.
- **Survival by Class**: Compares survival rates among different passenger classes.
- **Survival by Gender**: Analyzes survival rates between males and females.
- **Survival by Age Group**: Investigates survival rates across age groups.
- **Survival by Family Size**: Examines survival rates based on family size aboard.

#### 2. Demographic Analysis

- **Passenger Count by Class**: Displays the number of passengers in each class.
- **Gender Distribution**: Shows the count of male and female passengers.
- **Age Distribution**: Visualizes the age distribution of passengers.
- **Embarkation Port Analysis**: Analyzes the number of passengers embarked from each port.

#### 3. Financial Analysis

- **Ticket Fare Distribution**: Plots the distribution of ticket fares.
- **Average Fare by Class**: Calculates the average fare paid by passengers in each class.
- **Fare vs. Survival**: Investigates the relationship between fare paid and survival rate.

#### 4. Class Analysis

- **Passenger Demographics by Class**: Displays demographic distributions within each passenger class.
- **Survival Rates by Class and Gender**: Compares survival rates across different classes by gender.
- **Fare Analysis by Class**: Analyzes the range and distribution of fares within each class.

#### 5. Additional Insights

- **Family Relationships and Survival**: Explores if passengers with family aboard had higher survival rates.
- **Cabin Location Analysis**: Investigates the impact of cabin locations (if data available).
- **Name Analysis**: Extracts titles (Mr., Mrs., etc.) and explores if they correlate with survival rates.

### Implementation

This project is implemented using Python with libraries like Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization. The menu-driven interface allows easy navigation between different analyses, providing clear and insightful visualizations to accompany each analysis.

### Getting Started

To begin exploring the Titanic dataset, clone this repository and ensure you have Python installed along with necessary libraries (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`). Run the main script and follow the prompts to select analyses from the menu.

### Example Usage

```bash
$ python interface.py
```

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
