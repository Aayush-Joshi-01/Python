Creating a menu-driven analysis project for the Titanic dataset sounds like a great idea! Here are some broad categories and specific analyses you can consider including in your project:

### 1. **Survival Analysis**
   - **Overall Survival Rate:** Calculate the percentage of passengers who survived.
   - **Survival by Class:** Compare survival rates among different passenger classes (1st, 2nd, 3rd).
   - **Survival by Gender:** Analyze survival rates between males and females.
   - **Survival by Age Group:** Investigate if there was any age-based pattern in survival rates.
   - **Survival by Family Size:** Check if passengers with family aboard had different survival rates.

### 2. **Demographic Analysis**
   - **Passenger Count by Class:** Show how many passengers belonged to each class.
   - **Gender Distribution:** Display the number of male and female passengers.
   - **Age Distribution:** Create histograms or density plots to visualize the age distribution of passengers.
   - **Embarkation Port Analysis:** Explore the number of passengers embarked from each port (Southampton, Cherbourg, Queenstown).

### 3. **Financial Analysis**
   - **Ticket Fare Distribution:** Analyze the distribution of ticket fares across different classes.
   - **Average Fare by Class:** Calculate the average fare paid by passengers in each class.
   - **Fare vs. Survival:** Investigate if there was any correlation between fare paid and survival rate.

### 4. **Class Analysis**
   - **Passenger Demographics by Class:** Explore the age, gender, and other demographic distributions within each class.
   - **Survival Rates by Class and Gender:** Compare survival rates across different classes broken down by gender.
   - **Fare Analysis by Class:** Analyze the range and distribution of fares paid within each passenger class.

### 5. **Additional Insights**
   - **Family Relationships:** Investigate if passengers with family members aboard had higher survival rates.
   - **Cabin Location:** If available, analyze if passengers' cabin locations had any impact on survival.
   - **Name Analysis:** Extract titles (Mr., Mrs., etc.) and explore if they correlate with survival rates.

### Menu Structure Suggestions:
You can structure your menu based on these analyses. Hereâ€™s an example:

1. **Survival Analysis**
   - Overall Survival Rate
   - Survival by Class

Sure, here are example functions you could implement for each category in your menu-driven Titanic dataset analysis project. These functions assume you are using Python with libraries such as Pandas for data handling and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization. You can adjust and expand upon them based on your specific analysis needs and dataset structure.

### 1. Survival Analysis

```python
def overall_survival_rate(df):
    survived_count = df['Survived'].sum()
    total_passengers = df['Survived'].count()
    survival_rate = (survived_count / total_passengers) * 100
    return survival_rate

def survival_by_class(df):
    survival_by_class = df.groupby('Pclass')['Survived'].mean() * 100
    return survival_by_class

def survival_by_gender(df):
    survival_by_gender = df.groupby('Sex')['Survived'].mean() * 100
    return survival_by_gender

def survival_by_age_group(df, bins=[0, 18, 30, 50, 100]):
    df['AgeGroup'] = pd.cut(df['Age'], bins=bins, labels=['0-18', '19-30', '31-50', '51+'])
    survival_by_age_group = df.groupby('AgeGroup')['Survived'].mean() * 100
    return survival_by_age_group

def survival_by_family_size(df):
    df['FamilySize'] = df['SibSp'] + df['Parch'] + 1
    survival_by_family_size = df.groupby('FamilySize')['Survived'].mean() * 100
    return survival_by_family_size
```

### 2. Demographic Analysis

    passenger_count_by_class = df['Pclass'].value_counts().sort_index()
    return passenger_count_by_class

def gender_distribution(df):
    gender_distribution = df['Sex'].value_counts()
    return gender_distribution

def age_distribution(df):
    age_distribution = df['Age'].plot(kind='hist', bins=20, edgecolor='black')
    plt.xlabel('Age')
    plt.title('Age Distribution of Passengers')
    plt.show()

def embarkation_port_analysis(df):
    embarkation_port_counts = df['Embarked'].value_counts()
    return embarkation_port_counts
```

Certainly! Here are some custom analysis functions that you can use with the Titanic dataset to gain insights:
 
### 1. Function to Calculate Survival Rates by a Categorical Variable
 
This function calculates survival rates grouped by a categorical variable such as 'sex', 'class', or 'embarked'.
 
```python
def survival_rate_by_category(data, category_col):
    categories = data[category_col].unique()
    survival_rates = []
    for category in categories:
        total_passengers = len(data[data[category_col] == category])
        survived_passengers = len(data[(data[category_col] == category) & (data['survived'] == 1)])
        survival_rate = survived_passengers / total_passengers
        survival_rates.append((category, survival_rate))
    return survival_rates
```
 
**Usage Example:**
```python
# Assuming 'df' is your DataFrame containing Titanic dataset
survival_rates_sex = survival_rate_by_category(df, 'sex')
print("Survival Rates by Sex:")
for sex, rate in survival_rates_sex:
    print(f"{sex}: {rate:.2f}")
 
survival_rates_class = survival_rate_by_category(df, 'class')
print("\nSurvival Rates by Class:")
for pclass, rate in survival_rates_class:
    print(f"{pclass}: {rate:.2f}")
```
 
### 2. Function to Plot Survival Rates
 
This function creates a bar plot to visualize survival rates by a categorical variable.
 
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
 
def plot_survival_rate(data, category_col):
    survival_rates = survival_rate_by_category(data, category_col)
    categories, rates = zip(*survival_rates)
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
    plt.bar(categories, rates, color='skyblue')
    plt.xlabel(category_col.capitalize())
    plt.ylabel('Survival Rate')
    plt.title(f'Survival Rates by {category_col.capitalize()}')
    plt.ylim(0, 1)
    plt.grid(axis='y', linestyle='--', alpha=0.7)
    plt.show()
```
 
**Usage Example:**
```python
plot_survival_rate(df, 'sex')
plot_survival_rate(df, 'class')
```
 
### 3. Function to Calculate Age Distribution of Passengers
 
This function calculates and plots the age distribution of passengers.
 
```python
def plot_age_distribution(data):
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
    plt.hist(data['age'].dropna(), bins=20, color='lightgreen', edgecolor='black')
    plt.xlabel('Age')
    plt.ylabel('Frequency')
    plt.title('Age Distribution of Passengers')
    plt.grid(axis='y', linestyle='--', alpha=0.7)
    plt.show()
```
 
**Usage Example:**
```python
plot_age_distribution(df)
```
 
### 4. Function to Calculate Correlation Heatmap
 
This function creates a heatmap to visualize correlations between numerical variables.
 
```python
import seaborn as sns
 
def correlation_heatmap(data):
    corr_matrix = data.corr()
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
    sns.heatmap(corr_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', linewidths=0.5)
    plt.title('Correlation Heatmap')
    plt.show()
```
 
**Usage Example:**
```python
correlation_heatmap(df[['survived', 'age', 'fare', 'pclass', 'sibsp', 'parch']])
```
 
### 5. Function to Calculate Survival Rate by Age Group
 
This function categorizes passengers into age groups and calculates survival rates.
 
```python
def survival_rate_by_age_group(data):
    bins = [0, 18, 30, 50, 100]
    labels = ['0-17', '18-29', '30-49', '50+']
    data['age_group'] = pd.cut(data['age'], bins=bins, labels=labels, right=False)
    age_groups = data['age_group'].unique()
    survival_rates = []
    for group in age_groups:
        total_passengers = len(data[data['age_group'] == group])
        survived_passengers = len(data[(data['age_group'] == group) & (data['survived'] == 1)])
        survival_rate = survived_passengers / total_passengers
        survival_rates.append((group, survival_rate))
    return survival_rates
```
 
**Usage Example:**
```python
survival_rates_age = survival_rate_by_age_group(df)
print("Survival Rates by Age Group:")
for group, rate in survival_rates_age:
    print(f"{group}: {rate:.2f}")
```
 
These functions provide different ways to analyze and visualize the Titanic dataset, helping you derive meaningful insights about the passengers' demographics, survival rates, and correlations between variables.
