# 1-D Array Practice

**Basic Array Creation**

* Create a 1-dimensional array with the numbers from 0 to 9.
* Create a 1-dimensional array containing only even numbers from 10 to 20.
* Create a 1-dimensional array with 10 linearly spaced numbers between 0 and 1.

**Array Calculations**

* Create a 1-dimensional array with numbers from 1 to 5 and calculate the square of each element.
* Create a 1-dimensional array with numbers from 1 to 5 and calculate the sum of all elements.
* Create a 1-dimensional array with numbers from 1 to 5 and calculate the cumulative sum of the elements.

**Array Statistics**

* Create a 1-dimensional array with numbers from 1 to 10 and find the maximum and minimum values.
* Create a 1-dimensional array with numbers from 1 to 10 and find the mean and standard deviation.

**Array Manipulation**

* Create an integer array showcasing only those numbers that are divisible by 3.
* Create a null array of any length with the middle values as natural numbers.
* Take a 1D array (length >= 11) and negate all elements present between the 5th and 7th positions (inclusive of upper and lower bounds).
* Create a 1-D array of 50 evenly spaced elements between 35 and 140 (inclusive).

# Project: Analyzing Temperature Data

**Data Generation**

* Generate a 1-dimensional array of daily temperatures for 30 days.

**Data Analysis**

* Find the average temperature for the month.
* Determine the hottest and coldest days of the month.
* Find the number of days the temperature was above the monthly average.

# Project: Analyzing Sales Data

**Data Generation**

* Create an array representing daily sales over 30 days, with sales numbers as random integers between 50 and 200.

**Sales Analysis**

* Compute total sales.
* Compute the average daily sales.
* Find the highest and lowest sales days.
* Compute a 7-day moving average of sales to identify trends.
* Identify days where sales were above the moving average.

# Project: Sales Data Analysis from CSV

**Data Import**

* Read the 'sales_data.csv' file using Python's CSV module and extract the sales data into a list.
* Convert the sales data list into a NumPy array.

**Sales Analysis**

* Calculate the total sales.
* Calculate the average sales.
* Find the maximum sales in a month.
* Find the minimum sales in a month.
* Identify months with sales above a certain threshold (e.g., 25000).
