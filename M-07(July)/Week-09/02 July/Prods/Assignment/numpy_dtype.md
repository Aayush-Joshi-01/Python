# Numpy Data Type Practice

- Create a 1D array of integers from 1 to 5 with data type int32.

- Create a 2D array of shape (3, 3) with data type float64 where all elements are zero.

- Create a 3D array of shape (2, 2, 2) with random integers between 0 and 100 with data type int8.

- Convert a 1D array of integers to an array of floats.

- Create a 2D array of shape (2, 3) with data type float32 and then convert it to int32.
