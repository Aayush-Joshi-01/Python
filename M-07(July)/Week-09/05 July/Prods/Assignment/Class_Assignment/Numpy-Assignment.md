# Numpy Array Reshape Examples

### Reshaping 1D Arrays

Create a 1D array with 12 elements and reshape it:
- Creating a 1D array. 
- Reshaping to a 2D array (3x4). 
- Reshaping to a 2D array (4x3). 
- Reshaping to a 3D array (2x3x2). 
- Flattening the 3D array back to 1D. 

Create a 1D array with 12 elements and reshape it into a 2D array with 3 rows and 4 columns.
- Reshape to a 2x3x4 array.
- Reshape to a 2x5x3 array, then reshape it back to a 5x6 array.

Create a 1D array with values from 0 to 23. Reshape it to a 3D array with dimensions (2, 3, 4).

Concatenate two 1D arrays of size 10, reshape the resulting array to a 2D array with dimensions (2, 10).

Split a 1D array of values from 0 to 29 into three equal parts and reshape each part to a 2D array with dimensions (2, 5).

### Reshaping 2D Arrays

Create a 2D array filled with random numbers, reshape it into a (3, 8) array, then reshape it back into a 1D array.

Create a 2D array of shape (4, 4), reshape it into (2, -1). The resulting array shape.

### Reshaping 3D Arrays

Create a 1D array and reshape it to:
- A 3D array of shape (2, 3, 4).
- A 3D array of shape (5, 2, 3).

Create a 3D array and reshape it to:
- A 2D array of shape (6, 4).
- A 2D array of shape (12, 5).
- A 2D array with 5 rows.

Create a 3D array and flatten it into a 1D array.

### Advanced Reshaping

Create a 3D array of shape (4, 3, 2) and reshape it into a 2D array with 6 rows.

Create a 1D array, reshape it to a 3D array of shape (3, 4, 5), then to a 2D array of shape (15, 4).

Create a 3D array, flatten it to a 1D array, reshape it to a 2D array of shape (4, 6), and finally reshape it back to a 3D array of shape (2, 6, 2).

Create a 1D array and reshape it into a 2D array of shape (4, 5). Flatten it, then reshape it into a 3D array of shape (2, 2, 5).

Create a 3D array with shape (3, 3, 3), fill it with random integers, reshape it into a 2D array, and sort all elements in ascending order.
