### 1. `Controllers/`
 
- **data_processor_controller.py**: This file contains the `DataProcessorController` class, which provides an interface to interact with the `DataProcessor`. It includes methods to perform various data processing and reporting functions. This class is designed to be called from the main menu-driven interface in `main.py`.
- **group_viewer.py**: This file contains show_data function that enables the user to view different columns as per the analytical needs.
 
### 2. `Models/`
 
- **data_loader.py**: This file contains the `DataLoader` class, responsible for loading the training data from various sources (e.g., CSV, database). It abstracts the data loading process, ensuring that the rest of the project can work with a consistent data format.
 
- **data_processor.py**: This file contains the `DataProcessor` class, which provides various data analysis functions. It includes methods for grouping, reporting, and visualizing the training data. The `DataProcessor` class is the core of the data analysis process.

### 3. `Decorators/`
- **Logger_Analysis.py**: This file contain ths logger decorator the takes the fucntion wraps it and generate the logs of the fucntion while keeping the identity of the fucntion as it is.
- **Login_Analysis.py**: This file contains the login decorator tha login the user first then let the user access the functionalities of the analysis system and also gives sign up functionalities.

### 4. `Data/`
This contains the `cleaned_data.csv` that is the cleaned data after pre-processing. 

### 5. `Reports/`
 
This directory contains subdirectories for storing generated reports and visualizations.
 
- **CSV_Reports/**: This subdirectory stores CSV reports generated by the `DataProcessor`.
 
- **Visualizations/**: This subdirectory stores visualization plots generated by the `DataProcessor`.
 
### 6. `main.py`
 
This is the main entry point of the project. It contains a menu-driven interface that allows users to interact with the `DataProcessorController`. Users can choose from various options to perform data analysis and generate reports.

### 7. `Routes/`
- **analysis_url.py**: This file contains a route function that maps the callable to the specific routes being passed from the main_interface.py along with the `*args, **kwargs`

### 8. `Utils/`
- **data_utils.py**: This contains general cleaning operational function to clean the data, it's an one time operational file, that is that you have to run it once either manually or it can be integrated into the code.
- **plot_utils.py**: This contains general plot fucntions to plot the graphs generally like plots, bar graphs, histograms, etc.

### 9. `Logs/`
- **Analysis_Logs.json**: This contains all the logs that are being generated throughout the functioning of program to catch any problems and all the operations returns being done.
 
### 10. `requirements.txt`
 
This file lists all the dependencies required for the project. It can be used to set up the project environment by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
 
### 11. `README.md`
 
This file provides an overview of the project, including the folder structure and usage instructions.
 
## Usage Instructions
 
### 1. Setting Up the Environment
 
To set up the environment, run the following command:
 
```bash
python -m venv .venv

.venv/Script/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
 
### 2. Running the Project
 
To start the project, run the `main.py` file:
 
```bash
python main_interace.py
```
 
This will launch a menu-driven interface where you can choose various data processing and reporting options.
 
### 3. Data Loading
 
The `DataLoader` class in `data_loader.py` is responsible for loading the training data. Ensure that the data file path is correctly specified in the `DataLoader`.
 
### 4. Data Processing and Reporting
 
The `DataProcessor` class in `data_processor.py` provides various methods for analyzing the data. These methods can be accessed through the `DataProcessorController` in `data_processor_controller.py`.
 
### 5. Generating Reports
 
Reports and visualizations are generated and saved in the `Reports/` directory. You can customize the report generation process by modifying the methods in the `DataProcessor`.
